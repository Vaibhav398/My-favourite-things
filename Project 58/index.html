      <p> My hobbie is to create and craft different things from different material for eg. paper, cardboard, plastic, wires and other recyclable materials. Whenever I get some freetime like after school and classes I take some material and try to create things which I can create with them. I am 11 years old and study in sixth standard. I have this hobby since I was 4 years old. In school also my friends help me creating new things. They also give me their ideas of things I can create. I feel vey happy when I create things from different materials.  I must say, everyone has a hobbie all we have to do is to find it and practice it and use it in daily life you will see that you feel much better.
